<p align="center"><code>biryani shuru</code> is the entrypoint for the program and all program must end with <code>biryani barkhast</code>. Anything outside of it will be ignored.</p>

```

This will be ignored

biryani shuru
// Write code here
biryani barkhast

This too
```

<h3 align="center">Variables</h3>
<p align="center">Variables can be declared using <code>dekho yaaro ye hai</code>.</p>

```

biryani shuru
  dekho yaaro ye hai a = 10;
  dekho yaaro ye hai b = "two";
  dekho yaaro ye hai c = 15;
  a = a + 1;
  b = 21;
  c *= 2;
biryani barkhast
```

<h3 align="center">Types</h3>
<p align="center">Numbers and strings are like other languages. Null values can be denoted using <code>nalla. sahi and galat</code> are the boolean values for true and false respectively</p>

```

biryani shuru
  dekho yaaro ye hai a = 10;
  dekho yaaro ye hai b = 10 + (15*20);
  dekho yaaro ye hai c = "two";
  dekho yaaro ye hai d = 'ok';
  dekho yaaro ye hai e = nalla;
  dekho yaaro ye hai f = sahi;
  dekho yaaro ye hai g = galat;
biryani barkhast
```

<h3 align="center">Built-ins</h3>
<p align="center">Use <code>bolo yaaro</code> to print anything to console.</p>

```

biryani shuru
  bolo yaaro "Hello World";
  dekho yaaro ye hai a = 10;
  {
    dekho yaaro ye hai b = 20;
    bolo yaaro a + b;
  }
  bolo yaaro 5, 'ok', nalla , sahi , galat;
biryani barkhast
```

<h3 align="center">Conditionals</h3>
<p align="center">Hyderabadilang supports simple if else construct , <code>agar patthe</code> block will execute if condition is <code>sahi</code> and <code>sub hath diye to</code> block will execute if condition is <code>galat</code>.</p>

```

biryani shuru
â€ƒâ€ƒdekho yaaro ye hai a = 10;
â€ƒâ€ƒagar patthe (a < 25) {
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒbolo yaaro "a is less than 25";
â€ƒâ€ƒ} sub hath diye to {
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒbolo yaaro "a is greater than or equal to 25";
â€ƒâ€ƒ}
biryani barkhast
```

<h3 align="center">Loops</h3>
<p align="center">Statements inside <code>jab tak ye hai</code> blocks are executed as long as a specified condition evaluates to sahi. If the condition becomes <code>galat</code>, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. Use <code>bas karo baigan</code> to break the loop and <code className="language-cpp">agla dekho baigan</code> to continue within loop.</p>

```

biryani shuru
â€ƒâ€ƒdekho yaaro ye hai a = 0;
â€ƒâ€ƒjab tak ye hai (a < 10) {
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒa += 1;
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒagar patthe (a == 5) {
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒbolo yaaro "andar se bolo yaaro ", a;
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒagla dekho baigan;
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ}
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒagar patthe (a == 6) {
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒbas karo baigan;
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ}
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒbolo yaaro a;
â€ƒâ€ƒ}
â€ƒâ€ƒbolo yaaro "done";
